# What is WARN?

The [Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/chapter-23) helps ensure advance notice in cases of qualified plant closings and mass layoffs. The [U.S. Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/layoffs/warn) has compliance assistance materials to help [workers](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/Layoff/pdfs/WorkerWARN2003.pdf) and [employers](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/Layoff/pdfs/_EmployerWARN2003.pdf) understand their rights and responsibilities under the provisions of WARN.

# WARN Notices Details

WARN Notices must contain specific information as required by [federal regulations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/20/639.7)

* Name and address of the employment site where the plant closing or layoff will occur
* Name and telephone number of a company official to contact for further information
* Statemenet as to whether the planned action is expected to be temporary, and, if the entire plant is to be closed
* The expected date for the first seperation
* The anticipated schedule for making seperations
* The job tiles of positions to be affected, and the number of affected employees in each job classification
* Bumping rights
* Union and the name and address of each union

However not all jurisdictions publish this information.

## Historical Data

The law became effective on February 4, 1989, so jurisdictions should have data going back from then to now, but not all data has been digitized or is otherwise available on the internet. Under applicable open records laws we can ask states for historical records or information in other file formats. 

## Working JSON Schema Draft

The standardized data format follows this structure:

```json
{
  "employer": {
    "name": "Company Name",
    "address": {
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "municipality": "City",
      "state": "ST",
      "zip": "12345"
    }
  },
  "location": {
    "street": "456 Layoff site",
    "municipality": "City",
    "state": "ST",
    "zip": "12345"
  },
  "union": {
    "name": "Union Name",
    "address": { ... }
  },
  "contact": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone": "555-0199"
  },
  "warn_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "layoff_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "type": "Closure | PermanentLayoff | TemporaryLayoff",
  "impacted": 123,
  "notes": "Optional notes",
  "link": "https://..."
}
